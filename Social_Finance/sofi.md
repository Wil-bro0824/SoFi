## **Overview and Origin**

* Social Finance(SoFi), Inc.
  
* EST. Aug 2011
  
* Founders: Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan, and Ian  Brady(Four students from the Standford Graduate School of Business)
  
* Four grad students of Standord University decided they wanted to help other students in their community with student debt loan options. According to Businessmodel Zoo, "The company originally focused on matching alumni of top-ranking US universities with recent graduates looking to refinance their student loans."

* SoFi was able to raise up to $1 billion dollars between 2011-2015, with funds from investors such as Morgan Stanley(2014), DCM Ventures(2012), The Bancorp(2013), Wellington Management(2015), Baseline(2012). 

## **Business Activities:**

* Social Finance started out reworking student debt which became successful, working with different companies to acheive refinance options for alumni students. This opened major doors for the fintech company who broke barriers in the housing industry in 2014. With many consumers jumping on board with the company new/refinancing now mortgages, student loan, personal loans, and now Auto loans with a recently added feature partnering with a company named MotoRefi. SoFi's main belief is to help consuers get their money right. SoFi believes that there are four key principles to meet this objective: Attack debt with a plan, Always have a safety net, Put your money to work and Save for retirement and other goals.

* The company's intended clients are people looking to either establish a new/refi credit lines(eg. mortgage, personal loan, auto, and student loan refi, credit cards). The company also provides Retirement services for indivuals in that space. Recently the company is planning to increase their fintech space by becoming a one stop shop. SoFi is more focused on millennials due to it's online banking presence and how it appeals to its market of consumers. Although there isn't really anything special about SoFi's offers beyond its competitors, it is working towards becoming a secure stop for all products/services including investments.

## **Landscape:**

* SoFi currently sits in the domain space of Lending. The company provides all products from student loan refinancing to Mortgage lending.

* SoFi continues to grow their online platform with new products introduced including this years introduction to Auto loans and newly found industry of investments. Recently, the Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings V accounced a merger with the online platform(Jan 7th). 

* Other companies in the specific lending domain are top competitors for SoFi: LendingHome, Avant, Funding Cicle, CommonBond, and LendingTree. With SoFi making more products available to the consumer the list of competitors grow over time depending on the specific product offered.


## **Results:**
* The biggest business impact of SoFi so far has been refinancing student loan debt and mortgages. Those same consumers trust SoFi enough to open a variety of more products with the company over time such as credit cards, accounts, or newly added Auto loans. 

* SoFi uses its customer service and ability to gain millenial clientel who are either getting out of college and have student loan debt or looking to pursue any of the other products offered. SoFi looks to retain these client by offering more than refinancing student loans.

* SoFi currently is leading in its domain industry on almost every catagory, specifically with customer service, and fast tracking loan information. The company plans to offer more products than its competitors with the newly addition to auto loans.

## **Recommendations:**

* If I were to advise the company on new products or services to provide, I would suggest providing digital merchant products for businesses of all sizes. This would allow companies to use my blockchain to conduct merchant transactions at a faster rate and secure as well.

* This would benefit the company in becoming more of a one stop shop for all consumers and businesses. I believe that this could help the company evolve and grow utilizing all assets to corner the market.

* Blockchain technology will be used to record transactions safely and secure while utilizing IOTs for companies to securely pay their subscription from a network base directly.

* These two technologies would be appropiate because it could help the company to perform to its full potential at a fast rate within minutes with a secure and safe connection.
